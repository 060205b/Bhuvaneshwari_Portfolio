            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project implements a YouTube comment classifier that utilizes sentiment analysis to evaluate and categorize user comments on YouTube videos. By leveraging the YouTube Data API and the VADER sentiment analysis library, this tool can automatically assess the sentiment of comments as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, while also tracking the number of likes associated with each comment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-container">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>With the increasing volume of user comments on YouTube videos, content creators and marketers need effective methods to gauge audience sentiment. Manually reading through comments to determine viewer opinions is time-consuming and impractical. Therefore, the goal of this project is to automate the process of sentiment analysis on YouTube comments, providing valuable insights into viewer perceptions through a structured approach.</p>

        <div class="content-container">
            <h2>Data Analysis and Visualizations</h2>
            <p>The project retrieves comments from a specified YouTube video using the YouTube Data API. The comments are analyzed for sentiment using the VADER Sentiment Analysis library, which provides a sentiment score for each comment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Comment Retrieval:</strong> Fetches up to 100 comments at a time, including their like counts, until all comments are retrieved.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Each comment is evaluated to classify it into Positive, Negative, or Neutral categories based on its sentiment score.</li>
                <li><strong>Sentiment Distribution:</strong> After processing the comments, the overall sentiment percentages are calculated, providing insights into audience reactions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="content-container">
            <h2>Model Building</h2>
            <p>The model is not a traditional machine learning model but rather a pipeline that combines comment retrieval from the YouTube Data API and sentiment scoring using the VADER sentiment analysis tool. The sentiment analysis involves initializing the VADER Sentiment Intensity Analyzer and processing each comment to obtain sentiment scores and categorize them based on predefined thresholds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-container">
            <h2>Model Saving</h2>
            <p>Although this project does not involve saving a trained model, it saves sentiment scores and comment data in the comments_data list for further analysis and reporting. If required, the results can be exported to a CSV file or a database for persistent storage and later use.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-container">
