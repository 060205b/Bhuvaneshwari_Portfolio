        <!-- Problem Statement -->
        <section class="content-container problem-statement">
            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Traditional methods lack efficiency and accuracy, especially with large datasets and varied handwriting styles. Manual verification is time-intensive and prone to human error, while conventional algorithms may not effectively distinguish authentic from forged signatures. This project aims to solve these challenges by developing a high-accuracy model for efficient signature classification using a CNN architecture.</p>
